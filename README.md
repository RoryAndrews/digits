# Overview

A web app that keeps a list of contacts which can be added to by logged in users.

# Usage

Invoke the web app for the first time in development with the following code in the command line of the /app/ directory:
```
% meteor --settings ../config/settings.development.json
```
If you are in production you will want to use this line instead:
```
% meteor --settings ../config/settings.production.json
```
These files setup the the initial user accounts.
